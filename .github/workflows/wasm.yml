# WebAssembly build check for signal-fish-client
#
# Target: wasm32-unknown-unknown
#   This is the standard Rust target for browser/web WebAssembly. It is used by
#   wasm-bindgen, wasm-pack, and web-targeting game engines (Bevy, Godot HTML5,
#   Unity WebGL). The "unknown-unknown" triple means: no vendor, no OS — the
#   binary runs inside a browser or WASM runtime sandbox, not a traditional OS.
#   Cross-compiling for this target requires only `rustup target add
#   wasm32-unknown-unknown`; no special hardware is needed.
#
# Feature flags:
#   `transport-websocket` is excluded because it depends on tokio-tungstenite
#   over TCP sockets, which are unavailable in the browser sandbox. Consumers
#   targeting WASM can supply their own transport implementation via the
#   Transport trait.
