# yamllint configuration tuned for GitHub Actions workflow files.
#
# Key overrides:
#   - document-start disabled (workflow files omit ---)
#   - truthy check-keys disabled (GHA uses `on:` which is a YAML truthy value)
#   - line-length raised to 200 (GHA expressions can be long)
#   - comments min-spaces-from-content set to 1 (default 2 is too strict for our style)
#   - comments-indentation disabled (section-header comments are non-standard)
