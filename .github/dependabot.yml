# Dependabot v2 configuration for signal-fish-client
#
# Keeps Cargo dependencies and GitHub Actions up to date via automated PRs.
# PRs target the default branch (main) and trigger the full CI check suite.
#
# Grouping strategy:
#   - Cargo patch/minor updates are batched into a single PR to reduce noise.
#   - GitHub Actions patch/minor updates are batched into a single PR.
#   - Major version bumps (Cargo and Actions) get individual PRs for careful review.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
